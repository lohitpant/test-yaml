## Getting started

### The Basics

Contributing to a project on GitHub is pretty straight forward. If this is your first time, these are the steps you should take:

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/devopselvis/github-actions-presentation-2025/fork)
2. Make your change(s) in your fork - it doesn't matter which branch
3. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/devopselvis/github-actions-presentation-2025/compare) back to the **main** branch of this repo
4. That's it! Give me some time to review and approve the PR
